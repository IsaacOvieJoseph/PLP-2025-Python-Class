# Week 4 : File Handling and Error Exception
A simple python script that is capable of turning all letters in a file into uppercase and save this modified content into a different file.

User uploads the input file by submitting the file path and aso determines name of the output file.
- Input file requires file path including the file's extension
- User does not need to include extension in the output file name - the program saves its output as .txt file
